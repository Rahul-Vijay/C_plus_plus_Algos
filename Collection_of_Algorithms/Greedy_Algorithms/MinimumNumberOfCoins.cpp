/*Problem description


This problem states that if we have a value x and we want to make change of x Rs. with an infinite supply of denominations(user defined),
we should use minimum number of coins to make the change.

Example: suppose we want change of Rs.153. This can be done in two ways:

A) 153=50+50+50+2+1 (5 coins used)
B) 153=100+50+2+1   (4 coins used)

According to algorithm, to make change of Rs. 153, option B is the best as less number of coins are used.
